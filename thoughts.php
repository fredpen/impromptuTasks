I have successfully create a task<

There are two things to move on too

first would be to create a notification system for most activites
    each process will have its own notification class that sens a tiny notifs
    considering both database and emal

second would be to create the task and sub task page
so someone can assit me to upload task and subtasks

i think its better i do that first so that i can work on something else while someone assit in doing that

///////things to still implements
    allow people to create a task sub category,
    if anyone cant find its address he or she should do well to specify his closest adress in the adress bar
